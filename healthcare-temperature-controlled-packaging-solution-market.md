<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Healthcare Temperature Controlled Packaging Solution Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Active</li><li>Passive</li></ul></p>
<p><p>In the healthcare temperature-controlled packaging solution market, two primary types are recognized: active and passive. Active solutions utilize technology, such as refrigerants or temperature-regulating devices, to maintain specific temperatures during transport, ensuring precise climate control. On the other hand, passive solutions rely on thermal insulation and phase change materials to maintain temperature without external power sources. While active systems offer greater control and responsiveness, passive systems are generally lighter and more cost-effective, making both essential for preserving drug and vaccine integrity.</p></p>
