<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation Device Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Veno Artrial (VA)</li><li>Veno Venous (VV)</li><li>Artrio Venous</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation (ECMO) devices are classified into three main types based on their configuration and function. Veno-Arterial (VA) ECMO supports both heart and lung function by providing oxygenated blood to the body while bypassing the heart. Veno-Venous (VV) ECMO primarily supports lung function by draining deoxygenated blood and returning oxygenated blood to the venous system. Artrio-Venous ECMO is less common and typically utilized for specific scenarios, targeting support for patients with acute respiratory or cardiac failure.</p></p>
