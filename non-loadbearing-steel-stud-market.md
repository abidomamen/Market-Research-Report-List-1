<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Non-Loadbearing Steel Stud Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Hot-rolled Steel (HRS)</li><li>Cold-formed Steel (CFS)</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The non-loadbearing steel stud market comprises mainly two types: hot-rolled steel (HRS) and cold-formed steel (CFS). HRS is produced through high-temperature processes, providing strength and durability, making it suitable for applications where structural integrity is essential. In contrast, CFS is manufactured at room temperature, resulting in lighter, more versatile profiles ideal for interior partitioning and non-structural applications. Both types offer advantages in terms of cost, installation speed, and design flexibility, catering to various construction needs and preferences.</p></p>
